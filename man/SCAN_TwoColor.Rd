  Single-Channel Array Normalization (SCAN) for Agilent two-color expression microarrays
}
\description{
  This function is used to normalize Agilent two-color expression microarrays via the SCAN method.
}
\usage{
SCAN_TwoColor(inFilePattern, outFilePath = NA, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{inFilePattern}{
     Absolute or relative path to the input file to be processed. To process multiple files, wildcard characters can be  used (e.g., "*.txt"). Alternatively, a Gene Expression Omnibus identifier (e.g., GSE39655 or GSM1072833) can be specified. This is the only required parameter.
}
  \item{outFilePath}{
     Absolute or relative path where the output file will be saved. This is optional.
}
  \item{verbose}{
     Whether to output more detailed status information as files are normalized. Default is TRUE.
}
}
%\details{

\value{
  A list is returned, containing two elements: a matrix containing normalized data values and a vector of probe names that correspond to each row of the matrix. The matrix will contain two columns---one corresponding to each channel---for each sample. When the array design contains duplicate probe names (this is common for control probes), the vector of probe names will also contain duplicates.

\note{
  If a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) identifier is specified for the \code{inFilePattern} parameter, an attempt will be made to download the sample(s) directly from GEO. If a study identifier (e.g., GSE39655) is specified, all CEL files from that study will be downloaded. If a sample identifier (e.g., GSM1072833) is specified, only that sample will be downloaded.

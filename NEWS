CHANGES IN VERSION 2.5.8
-------------------------

Notes:

The SCAN_TwoColor and UPC_TwoColor functions have changed. They now return ExpressionSet objects (and by necessity, exclude any probes that contain duplicate names [control probes]).
Also UPC_RNASeq returns an ExpressionSet object.
Fixed a bug where UPC_RNASeq returned NA values if there was no entry in the annotation file.
TwoColor methods now add an integer suffix to each probe for which there is a duplicate name.


CHANGES IN VERSION 2.2.8
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Ability to download microarray data directly from
    Gene Expression Omnibus and normalize the files in
    a single command.

    o Alternate functions (SCANfast and UPCfast) for
    performing SCAN and UPC normalization that use fewer
    probes and thus execute in ~60% less time.

    o Ability to execute normalize multiple .CEL files in
    parallel either across multiple cores on a single
    computer or across multiple computers on a cluster.

    o Ability to generate RNA-Seq annotation files to be used
    with the UPC_RNASeq function from GTF/FASTA source files.

    o Ability to download and install BrainArray packages
    via an R function.

    o Improved support for Affymetrix exon arrays.

    o Improved support for Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A early
    access exon arrays.

OTHER

    o Various improvements and clarifications to the docs.

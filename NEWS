    Gene Expression Omnibus and normalize the files in

    o Ability to execute normalize multiple .CEL files in
    parallel either across multiple cores on a single
    computer or across multiple computers on a cluster.

    o Ability to generate RNA-Seq annotation files to be used
    with the UPC_RNASeq function from GTF/FASTA source files.

    o Ability to download and install BrainArray packages
    via an R function.

    o Improved support for Affymetrix exon arrays.

    o Improved support for Affymetrix HT_HG-U133A early

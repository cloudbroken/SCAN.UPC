Description: SCAN is a microarray normalization method to facilitate
        personalized-medicine workflows. Rather than processing
        microarray samples as groups, which can introduce biases and
        present logistical challenges, SCAN normalizes each sample
        individually by modeling and removing probe- and array-specific
        background noise using only data from within each array. SCAN
        can be applied to one-channel (e.g., Affymetrix) or two-channel
        (e.g., Agilent) microarrays. The Universal exPression Codes
        (UPC) method is an extension of SCAN that estimates whether a
        given gene/transcript is active above background levels in a
        given sample. The UPC method can be applied to one-channel or
        two-channel microarrays as well as to RNA-Seq read counts.
        Because UPC values are represented on the same scale and have
        an identical interpretation for each platform, they can be used
        for cross-platform data integration.
